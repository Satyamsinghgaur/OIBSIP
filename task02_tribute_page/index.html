      <h2>About Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as the "Missile Man of India", was an
        aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He played a pivotal role
        in India’s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in a humble family, Kalam rose to become a national hero through his dedication to science,
        education, and national development. He inspired millions of young Indians to dream big and never give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from his work in science, Dr. Kalam was also a teacher, writer, and motivational speaker. His books like
        <strong>"Wings of Fire"</strong> and <strong>"Ignited Minds"</strong> are a source of inspiration for students and young professionals.
